Temperature-and-Humidity-Monitoring-System 

Based on Peter Dalmaris's project. Some subtle upgrades were made:

1) added automation installation script 

2) added average, lowest, highest values with graphs

3) added room specification with server datetime

Just follow the instructions found in /setup/instructions.txt
